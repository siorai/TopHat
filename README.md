# TopHat
GPS enabled, LED controller

Attempting to search the internets for code that I can pull together to make my GPS enabled kandi top hat work. 

I'll be adding to the readme as I see fit, but for now i's going to remain pretty bare.

List of features I have yet to code and want

Ability to read two variables from the same file on the SD card to make that work. 

Control for the Adressable LEDs. 

Working code for the 9 axis sensor that's coming in the mail later today

interface with my phone - HM-06 blue tooth module

ability to upload sketches via my phone as well.
